# Centrix: The Ultimate Software for Centrifugal Fan Selection and Design
 
If you are a fan manufacturer or a fan engineer, you know how challenging and time-consuming it can be to select, design, cost and quote fans for various applications. You have to consider many factors such as aerodynamics, mechanics, noise, efficiency, materials and more. You also have to produce accurate and professional drawings and documents for your clients and suppliers.

But what if there was a software that could do all that for you in a matter of minutes? A software that could automate the fan selection and design process, calculate all the relevant parameters, generate CAD drawings and cutting profiles, estimate costs and labor hours, and produce a quotation document? A software that could save you hours of work and help you deliver high-quality products and services to your customers?
 
That software is Centrix: the advanced centrifugal fan selection and design program developed by H & R Resources, a company with over 30 years of experience in the fan industry. Centrix is a powerful and user-friendly software that enables you to select fans from a range of designs to suit any volume and pressure, plot performance curves, calculate noise levels, design silencers, mechanically design and calculate stresses, produce detail and arrangement drawings, automated drawings generation saved as Autocad dwg files, produce Autocad cutting profiles for the main components, estimate the costs, areas, weights and labor hours, produce a handing specific general arrangement drawing, and produce a quotation document[^1^].
 
Centrix is not just a fan selection software. It is also a fan design software that allows you to create your own aerodynamic designs and enter them into the Centrix database. Centrix uses these proportions and designs a range of fans by manipulating the fan laws. You can also customize the mechanical design of the fans by choosing different materials, thicknesses, shafts, bearings, pedestals and more. Centrix takes care of all the calculations and checks for you, such as impeller stresses, casing thickness, shaft critical speed, bearing selection and more[^1^].
 
Centrix is also a fan drawing software that produces automated CAD drawings on the fly. You can save these drawings as Autocad dwg files or export them as dxf files for use by other programs. You can also produce cutting profiles for the main components of the fan, such as impeller side plates and inlet cones. These profiles can be used by plasma or laser cutters to produce the parts quickly and accurately[^2^].
 
Centrix is also a fan costing software that estimates the costs, areas, weights and labor hours of each fan selection. You can adjust these values according to your own data and preferences. You can also produce a quotation document that includes all the relevant information about the fan selection, such as performance data, drawings, specifications, prices and terms[^1^].
 
Centrix is the ultimate software for centrifugal fan selection and design. It is a software that can help you improve your productivity, efficiency, accuracy and professionalism in your fan business. It is a software that can help you meet your customers' needs and expectations. It is a software that can help you grow your fan business.
