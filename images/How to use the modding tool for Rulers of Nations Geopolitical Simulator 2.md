## How to access the modding tool
 
To access the modding tool, launch Rulers of Nations Geopolitical Simulator 2 and click on "Modding Tool" in the main menu. You will see a window with four tabs: "Contexts", "Scenarios", "Customization" and "Options".
 
"Contexts" lets you create or edit contexts, which are sets of data that define the state of the world at a given time. You can modify country data (economic, political, demographic, fiscal...), change international relations between countries (diplomatic alignment, military alliances...), transform world geography (merging countries, making regions independent, putting a new city on the map...) and more.
 
"Scenarios" lets you create or edit scenarios, which are sets of events that happen in a context. You can create new missions and scenarios that are highly developed and detailed (triggering protests, wars, disasters, political scandals, assassinations, national elections, character demands... with the option of defining several conditions for triggering these events, and editing game text...). You can also remake history by creating scenarios starting in the past or the future, from year 1900.
 
"Customization" lets you enrich the scenarios with new character faces and names, new logos and group names with the customization kit that can be used with the modding tool.
 
"Options" lets you adjust some settings for the modding tool, such as language, resolution, sound and graphics.
 
## How to create a context
 
To create a new context, click on "New" in the "Contexts" tab. You will be asked to enter a name and a description for your context. Then you will see a map of the world with various buttons and menus on the left side.
 
You can use these buttons and menus to modify any aspect of the world that you want. For example, you can click on "Countries" to select a country and change its data (name, flag, population, GDP, debt, budget, taxes, inflation, unemployment, growth...). You can also click on "Relations" to select two countries and change their diplomatic relations (alignment, treaties, conflicts...).
 
You can also use the map to modify the geography of the world. You can click on "Map Editor" to enter a mode where you can draw new borders or erase existing ones. You can also click on "Add City" to place a new city on the map or "Delete City" to remove one.
 
When you are done with your context, click on "Save" to save it. You can also click on "Test" to test it in the game or "Share" to upload it to our website or send it directly from the game to other users.
